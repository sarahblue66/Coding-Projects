# Coding-Projects
This repository includes two main projects in my statistical computing course which involve heavy Python coding. Detailed descriptions of the two projects are included in the file instructions.pdf under each project subfolder.

autocomplete-me:
Implementing autocomplete using weighted tries(with a given set of N terms, where a term is a query string and an associated nonnegative weight). This program provides suggestions when given terms on the command line.


crime data:
Using python to automate data manipulation process in SQL. The process includes filtering and fixing data format to read into SQL database, ingesting data lines from local files, patching some old records, generating weekly reports or data summaries. The end result is a command-line based API.
