# Coding-Projects
This repository includes four main projects in my course work which involve heavy Python/R coding. Detailed descriptions of the projects are included in the file instructions.pdf under each project subfolder.

autocomplete-me:
Implementing autocomplete using weighted tries(with a given set of N terms, where a term is a query string and an associated nonnegative weight). This program provides suggestions when given terms on the command line.

crime data:
Using python to automate data manipulation process in SQL. The process includes filtering and fixing data format to read into SQL database, ingesting data lines from local files, patching some old records, generating weekly reports or data summaries. The end result is a command-line based API.

Data Mining:
Analysis done on the dataset containing 133 patients from two classes (a control class and a case class) with measurements on the same set of 248 genes which are selected from a much larger set of genes. The analysis of interest is to use both unsupervised(PCA,K-means and random forest) and supervised learning methods(ridge, lasso) to effectively assign class labels to each patient. 

Missing Data in Fingerprint Analysis:
Studies the underlying factors that contribute to jurors' perceptions of evidence strength. Further analysis focuses on the differences between incomplete survey responses and the complete ones. Bayesian statistics and ordinal logistic regression were involved.
